# V2C Trydan Card FAQ

## Does this replace the official V2C integration?

No. The card is an independent dashboard interface that uses entities exposed by the [official Home Assistant V2C integration](https://www.home-assistant.io/integrations/v2c/). It neither replaces nor modifies that integration.

## Which entity should I configure?

Use any entity belonging to the V2C Trydan device. A connected binary sensor is a good seed. The card discovers remaining roles through Home Assistant device-registry metadata.

## Why is energy flow not visible?

It is disabled by default since v0.4.2. Enable it explicitly:

~~~yaml
show_energy_flow: true
~~~

Then select sources in the visual editor and map missing entities if discovery cannot resolve them.

## Why is there no charger image in ultra compact mode?

That is intentional. Ultra compact prioritizes state, power and essential controls. <code>show_charger</code> remains stored and takes effect again in compact, standard or XXL.

## Why does the LCD language change?

LCD copy follows <code>language</code>. With <code>auto</code>, resolution order is card configuration, Home Assistant locale/language, browser and English fallback. The LCD is localized; the artwork itself contains no embedded text, since the LCD is drawn as a dot-matrix grid rather than rendered as real text.

## Are the LCD power values examples?

No. Charging uses the resolved power, current and voltage entities. Charge complete uses session energy. Readings appear only when valid entities provide them; missing values use translated fallback text.

## Why are controls missing?

Discovery only enables a control when a valid entity with the expected domain is resolved. Add an override under <code>entities</code> and check the status shown by the Entities editor section.

## Why is an entity marked ambiguous?

Multiple candidates matched the same role. The card refuses to guess because a wrong match could call the wrong service. Select the intended entity manually.

## Why is an energy arrow reversed?

Use the matching <code>invert_grid_power</code>, <code>invert_battery_power</code> or <code>invert_solar_power</code> option. See power conventions in the configuration guide.

## The card does not appear after updating

Reload the browser, clear the frontend cache and confirm the resource URL is a JavaScript module. HACS users can use Redownload, then reload Home Assistant.

## What Home Assistant version is supported?

The HACS manifest declares Home Assistant 2024.1.0 or newer. Current releases are tested through the local demo and automated card contracts.

## Where should I send feedback?

Use [GitHub Discussions](https://github.com/mactron254/v2c-trydan-card/discussions) for ideas, questions, polls and dashboard examples. Open an [Issue](https://github.com/mactron254/v2c-trydan-card/issues/new?template=bug_report.yml) for a reproducible bug. Report vulnerabilities privately through [GitHub Security Advisories](https://github.com/mactron254/v2c-trydan-card/security/advisories/new).

Remove entity IDs, locations, SSIDs, private IP addresses, tokens and other personal data before posting.
