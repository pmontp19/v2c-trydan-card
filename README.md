A modern card for viewing and controlling a **V2C Trydan** charger from the Home Assistant dashboard. It uses entities from the [official Home Assistant V2C integration](https://www.home-assistant.io/integrations/v2c/), with a translated editor, visual controls and real-time data in one card. Install it through **HACS** or manually as a Lovelace EV charger card.

> Personal project shared with the community. It is not affiliated with or endorsed by V2C, and it does not replace the official integration.
>
> ⚠️ Use it responsibly: review your entities and test controls safely before relying on them. See the [MIT license](LICENSE).

- ☀️ Energy flow can be shown; it is off by default.
- 🔎 Discover charger entities automatically through the device registry, even when their visible names differ.
- 🎨 Tint the card's controls and surfaces with predefined palettes or any custom colour.
- 🖼️ Charger illustration cut from V2C's own product photography, with adjustable framing and an optional connector view. See [how the artwork is built](docs/artwork/README.md).

Ultra compact keeps status, readings and essential controls, but intentionally hides the charger image. Compare light and dark modes in the [visual guide](docs/VISUAL_GUIDE.md#densities).

The localized LCD follows the real sequence: **No vehicle → Vehicle connected → Charging**.

## 💡 Why I created this project

I created this V2C Trydan card for Home Assistant. When I looked for a generic EV charger card, the options I found did not cover what I needed or looked outdated. So, with AI help, I decided to create my own card for the V2C Trydan: a card that lets me monitor and control the charger.

I made it for my dashboard and, now that it works, I want to share it with the community in case it helps other EV owners too.

## 🤖 Project made with AI

I want to explain transparently how it was made:

- I came up with the project, set the direction and tested the results on a real Trydan installation.
- **Codex / OpenAI** helped with development, tests, documentation and reproducible media.
- Product decisions and final acceptance remain human-led; AI has been an important help throughout the project.

## 📦 Install with HACS

[![Open your Home Assistant instance and add V2C Trydan Card through HACS](https://my.home-assistant.io/badges/hacs_repository.svg)](https://my.home-assistant.io/redirect/hacs_repository/?owner=mactron254&repository=v2c-trydan-card&category=plugin)

If the repository is not listed yet, add <code>https://github.com/mactron254/v2c-trydan-card</code> as a custom **Dashboard** repository in HACS. Install it, reload the browser and add the card from the dashboard editor.

### Manual installation

1. Download <code>v2c-trydan-card.js</code> from the [latest release](https://github.com/mactron254/v2c-trydan-card/releases/latest).
2. Copy it to <code>/config/www/v2c-trydan-card.js</code>.
3. Add <code>/local/v2c-trydan-card.js</code> as a JavaScript module under Dashboard resources.
4. Reload Home Assistant.

## ⚙️ Configuration

Start with any entity that belongs to the V2C device. The card discovers supported roles through stable device-registry metadata.

~~~yaml
type: custom:v2c-trydan-card
entity: binary_sensor.garage_v2c_charger_connected
~~~

The visual editor covers:

- **General:** device, language and primary behaviour.
- **Appearance:** theme, density, layout, accent, scale and card radius.
- **Content and order:** visible metrics, data sources and section order.
- **Entities:** device-registry discovery or explicit manual mappings.
- **Advanced:** amperage presets, services and optional energy flow.

Enable the energy summary only when wanted:

~~~yaml
show_energy_flow: true
~~~

Existing v0.4.0 YAML remains compatible. Ultra compact preserves <code>show_charger</code> so the illustration returns when another density is selected.

## 💬 Community, feedback and support

- Use [GitHub Discussions](https://github.com/mactron254/v2c-trydan-card/discussions) for ideas, questions, polls and dashboard examples.
- Open an [Issue](https://github.com/mactron254/v2c-trydan-card/issues/new?template=bug_report.yml) for a reproducible bug. Mature ideas from Discussions can later become Issues.
- Report vulnerabilities privately through [GitHub Security Advisories](https://github.com/mactron254/v2c-trydan-card/security/advisories/new).

I would love to hear your feedback, feature ideas and corrections. Before sharing logs or screenshots, remove entity IDs, locations, SSIDs, private IP addresses, tokens and any personal data.

## Discovery and safety

Choose a V2C entity from the intended charger as entity. Discovery is restricted to that V2C device; renamed IDs keep working through 	ranslation_key. Ambiguous roles are never guessed. External grid, home, solar and battery power require explicit entities overrides and must be valid power sensors. Controls are checked again immediately before calling Home Assistant services.
